# A simple Meteor Project Scaffold [Deprecated]

Its a simple set of geenral purpose packages and a folder structure with some boilerplate code fro starting Meteor Projects even faster.

**NB:**  while this is one way to structure a meteor project, in time I've found it to create unneccessary and confusing folder / file  structures as a project grows and will be moving to a module orientated approach for new projects.

## Included Packages

I've built up a package file with all of the essential packages and usual suspects for getting a project started as well as many optional ones that can be included by simply uncommenting them.  Check out this Gist for the full list : https://gist.github.com/Pushplaybang/454c2f2f7af94b7aa60a

**NB : ** the insecure and autopublish packages have not been removed.
