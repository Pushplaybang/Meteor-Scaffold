# A simple Meteor Project Scaffold

Its a simple set of geenral purpose packages and a folder structure with some boilerplate code fro starting Meteor Projects even faster.

## Included Packages

I've built up a package file with all of the essential packages and usual suspects for getting a project started as well as many optional ones that can be included by simply uncommenting them.  Check out this Gist for the full list : https://gist.github.com/Pushplaybang/454c2f2f7af94b7aa60a

**NB : ** the insecure and autopublish packages have not been removed.
